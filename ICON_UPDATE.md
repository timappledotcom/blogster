# Blogster Icon Update Summary

## ✅ Successfully Updated App Icon

### What Was Done:

1. **Background Removal**: Processed the new `blogster` JPEG icon to remove background and create transparency
2. **Multi-Size Generation**: Created all standard Linux icon sizes:
   - 16x16, 22x22, 24x24, 32x32, 48x48, 64x64, 128x128, 256x256, 512x512 pixels
3. **System Integration**: Added proper desktop file and icon installation to CMakeLists.txt
4. **Application Integration**: Updated the GTK application to use the new icon
5. **Launch Script**: Created `run_blogster.sh` for proper icon setup and app launching

### Files Modified:
- `assets/icons/` - Added new icon in multiple sizes
- `linux/runner/my_application.cc` - Added window icon setting
- `linux/CMakeLists.txt` - Added icon and desktop file installation
- `linux/blogster.desktop` - Created proper desktop entry
- `run_blogster.sh` - Created launch script with icon setup

### How to Run:

./run_blogster.sh
```

This script will:
1. Install icons to the user's local icon directory
2. Set up the desktop file for system integration
3. Update the icon cache
4. Launch Blogster with the new icon
